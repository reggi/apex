## How do you manage multiple environments?

It's highly recommended to create separate AWS accounts for staging and production environments. This provides complete isolation of resources, and allows you to easily provide granular access to environments as required. See [AWS credentials](#aws-credentials) for supplying an account profile.

## How is this different than Serverless?

Serverless uses CloudFormation to bootstrap resources, which can be great for getting started, but is generally less robust than [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) for managing infrastructure throughout its lifetime. For this reason Apex does not currently provide resource management. This may change in the future for light bootstrapping, likely in an optional form.

At the time of writing Serverless does not support shimming for languages which are not supported natively by Lambda, such as Golang. Apex does this for you out of the box.

The structures imposed by each project are different, as well as varying features, see the documentation for each project to see what either supports.

Serverless is written using Node.js, Apex is written in Go.

## Is using the Node.js shim slow?

The shim creates a child process, thus creates a few-hundred millisecond delay for the first invocation. Subsequent calls to a function are likely to hit an active container, unless the function sees very little traffic.

## Do shimmed languages have any limitations?

The shim currently operates using JSON over stdout, because of this you must use stderr for logging.

## Can I manage functions that Apex did not create?

Apex is not designed to handle legacy cases, or functions created by other software. For most operations Apex references the local functions, if it is not defined locally, then you cannot operate against it. This is by-design and is unlikely to change.
